## Lab 3 Assignment (ALAAM)

## In this lab, you will be building, estimating, and interpreting the results of Autologistic Actor
## Attribute Model (ALAAM) using the R to examine the effects of network ties on certain behaviors. 
## The R script is based on Johan Koskinen's workshop material and recent paper on Bayesian Analysis of
## Social Influence (Koskinen, J., & Daraganova, G. (2020). Bayesian Analysis of Social Influence. 
## arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.16464.) . In this code, they extended on current approaches for fitting
## ALAAMs by presenting a comprehensive Bayesian inference scheme that supports testing of dependencies
## across subsets of data and the presence of missing data. Please do NOT disseminate the code without
## permission.

# Setup and Data Preparation -------------------------------------------------------------------

## download the s50 dataset from the website
## For a description of the full dataset, see https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/s50_data.htm
temp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/s50_data.zip",temp)
adj <- read.table(unz(temp, "s50-network1.dat"))

smoke <- read.table(unz(temp, "s50-smoke.dat"))
alcohol <- read.table(unz(temp, "s50-alcohol.dat"))

## Format the network and set at the 2nd wave as our outcome variable
n <- nrow(adj)
adj <- as.matrix(adj) # convert from data.frame to matrix
smoke <- smoke[,2] # use wave 2
smoke[smoke<2] <- 0 # set non-smoker to 0
smoke[smoke>0] <- 1 # set occasional and regular to 1

## Download the script `MultivarALAAMalt.R` and read in the routines
# Make sure you have set the working directory to where you store the file
# If you have this script stored in the same folder
# Session ==> Set Working Directory ==> To Source File Location

# Format Covariates -------------------------------------------------------

## Below can be pre-calculated and used as monadic covariates
out.degree <-matrix( rowSums(adj), n, 1) # number of ties sent
in.degree <- matrix( colSums(adj) , n, 1 ) # number of ties received
rec.ties <-  matrix( rowSums(adj * t(adj) ), n , 1) # number of ties that are mutual
in.two.star <- matrix( choose(in.degree,2),n,1) #  in-stars refecting dispersion in popularity
out.two.star <- matrix( choose(out.degree,2),n,1) #  out-stars refecting dispersion in activity
mix.two.star <- in.degree*out.degree - rec.ties # correlation between indegree and outdegree
in.three.star <- matrix( choose(in.degree,3),n,1) # furhter measure of in-degree heterogeneity
out.three.star <- matrix( choose(out.degree,3),n,1) # furhter measure of out-degree heterogeneity
triangles <- rowSums( adj* (adj %*% t(adj) )  ) # embedded in transitive triads

## Format covariates by putting them all into a matrix (the column names are only required for formatting the output)
